            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>In December of 1995, two groups joined forces to become the Kirksville Arts Association. The Red Barn Community Art League was founded in 1973. Its focus was the Red Barn Festival.</p>
            <p>
            Later, the Kirksville Regional Arts Council was founded.  It focused on other arts activities, including arts education.  The merger helped both organizations to support more programs and to reach more people.</p>

         <p>On a cold December night in 2016, a fire broke out in the Kirksville Arts Center and destroyed the home of the Kirksville Arts Association. A total loss. Starting the very next day, the association members, volunteers and community banded together to begin the resurrection of this community art center. Extremely generous donations throughout the community have yielded positive results towards our goal of rebuilding. Please join us; donate your time and financial support to get us back home to Franklin Street.</p>

                Artist Clara Straight_0655

                Clara Straight has lead a very remarkable life. We at the Kirksville Arts Association would like to honor Clara and support her artwork. We will be exhibiting her paintings/artwork in the gallery June 21st to August 30th, 2019.

                Our goal is to raise $50,000 by Clara’s 100th birthday on August 28, 2019. We hope you will help us reach that goal. We will be hosting different fundraising events throughout the year and hope you will support this special campaign. In June 2019, in honor of Clara’s 100th birthday, the Kirksville Arts Association will have an exhibit of Clara’s private collection of her favorite works.

                Dear Kirksville Arts Community, <br>
                Please join us next Friday, March 1st for the 20th Annual Friends of the Gallery Fundraiser: Dream On, to be held in the University Art Gallery in Ophelia Parrish on the Truman State University Campus. Without these funds many of the national and international caliber exhibitions we bring to Kirksville would be out of reach, and funding for area school children to visit the gallery would be unavailable. This year’s theme “Dream On” reflects on the current exhibitions (last day also March 1st) and invites us to dream about the future of arts in Kirksville.<br>
                Suggested donation of $40 reduced to $20 to paying members of KAA and MOSI.<br>
                RSVP to stuckerpotter@truman.edu / 660-785-4133<br>
                Best wishes,<br>
                The Friends of the Gallery Committee

               North Missouri Fiber Artists <br>

                The purpose of this group is to explore the fiber arts and related topics. We seek to inspire, encourage, educate and share the joys of fiber arts with others. We provide a forum for showing work and getting meaningful feedback. The current interests of active members are broad including: sewing, cross stitch, dyeing, spinning, knitting, crochet and weaving. Exchange information and ideas. The group is open to anyone, at any stage of development in the fiber arts (from “want to learn” to expert) who is interested in participating in the Guild. We currently meet on the third Saturday of most months from 2-4 pm.<br>
